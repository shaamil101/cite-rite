# Potential improvements

If I had 2 more weeks, I would do the following:


1. **Show a skeleton loader**  
   Instead of a blank “Analyzing…” message, I'd try to display a lightweight skeleton or spinner inside each claim card so users know exactly where content will pop in.

2. **Highlight claims inline**  
   When I click “Go to Text,” I could flash a brief background highlight like a fade in/out around the selected snippet so folks immediately see what they’re looking for.

3. **Resizable panels**  
Could be cool to let users drag the divider between the editor and results. That way they can give more real estate to whichever pane they need.

4. **Copy‑to‑clipboard for citations**  
   Add a little “Copy citation” button next to each snippet or summary so people can grab the text (or link) in one click. 

5. **Copy citations in certain formats**  
   
   As a student myself who has needed to find citations, it could be cool to copy the citations in certain formats like MLA or Chicago for papers.

5. **Progress bar feedback**  
   Turn the circular progress green when they’re under the limit, and red when they hit 100%—a quick visual cue that they need to trim or split their text.

6. **Mobile & accessibility**  
   - Collapse into a single column on narrow screens.  
   - Maybe add `aria-label`s on all buttons/icons so screen‑reader users can navigate easily.
